# GeoCoding Project

This project is used to find the Geocoding of a location, i.e., Lattitude and Longtitude.<br>
<br>
This will help the user find these details for a huge number of location whether it's in text file, CSV file or any other file. <br>
<br>
Now you need an API key to run this code, I've used the OpenCage Geocoder service to achieve the task. If you want you can get your own API key by registering into their website and IT'S FREE OF COST!!
<br>
Happy Learning!!

<br>Kind Regards,
