# Projects with APIs

APIs are very powerful tools to write code efficiently and achieve tasks at ease.

Say for example you have to get the current Exchange Rates of currencies, there are two options:

1)You could go online and check the price every now and then and then update them into your code.<br>

2)Else you could use an API which would do this task for you periodically without you even opening your browser.


Sounds interesting right?? You'll find the repo with such projects.

Happy Learning!!
